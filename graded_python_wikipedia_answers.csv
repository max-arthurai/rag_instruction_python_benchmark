Main article: History of Python
Python was invented in the late 1980s[41] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[42] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[11] Its implementation began in December 1989.[43] Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his ""permanent vacation"" from his responsibilities as Python's ""benevolent dictator for life"" (BDFL), a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker[44] (he's since come out of retirement and is self-titled ""BDFL-emeritus""). In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.[45][46]
Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support.[47] Python 3.0, released on 3 December 2008, with many of its major features backported to Python 2.6.x[48] and 2.7.x. Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.[49]
Python 2.7's end-of-life was initially set for 2015, then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.[50][51] No further security patches or other improvements will be released for it.[52][53] Currently only 3.8 and later are supported (2023 security issues were fixed in e.g. 3.7.17, the final 3.7.x release[54]). While Python 2.7 and older is officially unsupported, a different unofficial Python implementation, PyPy, continues to support Python 2, i.e. ""2.7.18+"" (plus 3.9 and 3.10), with the plus meaning (at least some) ""backported security updates"".[55]
In 2021 (and again twice in 2022), security updates were expedited, since all Python versions were insecure (including 2.7[56]) because of security issues leading to possible remote code execution[57] and web-cache poisoning.[58] In 2022, Python 3.10.4 and 3.9.12 were expedited[59] and 3.8.13, because of many security issues.[60] When Python 3.9.13 was released in May 2022, it was announced that the 3.9 series (joining the older series 3.8 and 3.7) would only receive security fixes in the future.[61] On 7 September 2022, four new releases were made due to a potential denial-of-service attack: 3.10.7, 3.9.14, 3.8.14, and 3.7.14.[62][63]
As of October 2023, Python 3.12 is the stable release, and 3.12 and 3.11 are the only versions with active (as opposed to just security) support. Notable changes in 3.11 from 3.10 include increased program execution speed and improved error reporting.[64]
Python 3.12 adds syntax (and in fact every Python since at least 3.5 adds some syntax) to the language, the new (soft) keyword type (recent releases have added a lot of typing support e.g. new type union operator in 3.10), and 3.11 for exception handling, and 3.10 the match and case (soft) keywords, for structural pattern matching statements. Python 3.12 also drops outdated modules and functionality, and future versions will too, see below in Development section.
Python 3.11 claims to be between 10 and 60% faster than Python 3.10, and Python 3.12 adds another 5% on top of that. It also has improved error messages, and many other changes.
Since 27 June 2023, Python 3.8 is the oldest supported version of Python (albeit in the 'security support' phase), due to Python 3.7 reaching end-of-life.[65]
Python 3.13 has a garbage collector which is now incremental (can mean much shorter pauses), and has an experimental JIT compiler;[66] and it removes from the C API (and removes some standard library modules, 19 dead batteries, and many deprecated classes, functions and methods, and more will be removed in Python 3.15 and or 3.16).[67] Starting with 3.13, it and later versions have 2 years of full support (up from one and a half); followed by 3 years of security support (for same total support as before).",Which lesser used syntax constructs or 'hidden features' in Python remain unknown to many mid or even expert level developers?,False,"I cannot answer this question as the context provided does not discuss any ""hidden features"" or lesser-known syntax constructs in Python that mid or expert-level developers may be unaware of.",grounded_correct,"Some lesser-used syntax constructs in Python include structural pattern matching statements using the match and case keywords, which were introduced in Python 3.10.

History[edit]

The designer of Python, Guido van Rossum, at OSCON 2006
Main article: History of Python
Python was invented in the late 1980s[41] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[42] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[11] Its implementation began in December 1989.[43] Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his ""permanent vacation"" from his responsibilities as Python's ""benevolent dictator for life"" (BDFL), a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker[44] (he's since come out of retirement and is self-titled ""BDFL-emeritus""). In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.[45][46]
Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support.[47] Python 3.0, released on 3 December 2008, with many of its major features backported to Python 2.6.x[48] and 2.7.x. Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.[49]
Python 2.7's end-of-life was initially set for 2015, then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.[50][51] No further security patches or other improvements will be released for it.[52][53] Currently only 3.8 and later are supported (2023 security issues were fixed in e.g. 3.7.17, the final 3.7.x release[54]). While Python 2.7 and older is officially unsupported, a different unofficial Python implementation, PyPy, continues to support Python 2, i.e. ""2.7.18+"" (plus 3.9 and 3.10), with the plus meaning (at least some) ""backported security updates"".[55]
In 2021 (and again twice in 2022), security updates were expedited, since all Python versions were insecure (including 2.7[56]) because of security issues leading to possible remote code execution[57] and web-cache poisoning.[58] In 2022, Python 3.10.4 and 3.9.12 were expedited[59] and 3.8.13, because of many security issues.[60] When Python 3.9.13 was released in May 2022, it was announced that the 3.9 series (joining the older series 3.8 and 3.7) would only receive security fixes in the future.[61] On 7 September 2022, four new releases were made due to a potential denial-of-service attack: 3.10.7, 3.9.14, 3.8.14, and 3.7.14.[62][63]
As of October 2023, Python 3.12 is the stable release, and 3.12 and 3.11 are the only versions with active (as opposed to just security) support. Notable changes in 3.11 from 3.10 include increased program execution speed and improved error reporting.[64]
Python 3.12 adds syntax (and in fact every Python since at least 3.5 adds some syntax) to the language, the new (soft) keyword type (recent releases have added a lot of typing support e.g. new type union operator in 3.10), and 3.11 for exception handling, and 3.10 the match and case (soft) keywords, for structural pattern matching statements. Python 3.12 also drops outdated modules and functionality, and future versions will too, see below in Development section.
Python 3.11 claims to be between 10 and 60% faster than Python 3.10, and Python 3.12 adds another 5% on top of that. It also has improved error messages, and many other changes.
Since 27 June 2023, Python 3.8 is the oldest supported version of Python (albeit in the 'security support' phase), due to Python 3.7 reaching end-of-life.[65]
Python 3.13 has a garbage collector which is now incremental (can mean much shorter pauses), and has an experimental JIT compiler;[66] and it removes from the C API (and removes some standard library modules, 19 dead batteries, and many deprecated classes, functions and methods, and more will be removed in Python 3.15 and or 3.16).[67] Starting with 3.13, it and later versions have 2 years of full support (up from one and a half); followed by 3 years of security support (for same total support as before).","What types of performance gains, architectural changes or new capabilities would be needed for Python to displace dominant languages like C++, Java or C# in their niche application domains?",False,"I cannot answer this question as the context provided does not discuss the performance, architectural changes, or new capabilities needed for Python to displace other dominant programming languages.",grounded_correct,"According to the context you provided, Python has evolved to become significantly faster and more efficient over recent versions, with Python 3.11 claiming to be up to 60% faster than its previous iteration. However, the niche application domains of established languages like C++, Java, and C# would require substantial gains in performance. 

Python's recent incremental garbage collector and experimental JIT compiler are steps towards improved performance, but the language's interpretation and dynamic typing may limit its ability to displace these compiled, statically-typed languages in their strongholds.",grounded_correct,"```
I cannot provide information on the context outside of the provided text. However, I can provide a brief answer based on the context. 

To displace dominant languages like C++, Java, or C# in their niche application domains, Python would need significant performance gains, architectural changes, and new capabilities. 

Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its dynamic typing and garbage collection may not be suitable for high-performance, real-time, or embedded systems. 

To compete, Python would need to improve its performance, especially in areas like memory management, concurrency, and parallel processing. 

Additionally, Python would need to address its limitations in areas like type safety, compile-time evaluation, and support for low-level system programming. 

This would require significant changes to the language, its runtime, and its standard library.

Main article: History of Python
Python was invented in the late 1980s[41] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[42] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[11] Its implementation began in December 1989.[43] Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his ""permanent vacation"" from his responsibilities as Python's ""benevolent dictator for life"" (BDFL), a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker[44] (he's since come out of retirement and is self-titled ""BDFL-emeritus""). In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.[45][46]
Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support.[47] Python 3.0, released on 3 December 2008, with many of its major features backported to Python 2.6.x[48] and 2.7.x. Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.[49]
Python 2.7's end-of-life was initially set for 2015, then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.[50][51] No further security patches or other improvements will be released for it.[52][53] Currently only 3.8 and later are supported (2023 security issues were fixed in e.g. 3.7.17, the final 3.7.x release[54]). While Python 2.7 and older is officially unsupported, a different unofficial Python implementation, PyPy, continues to support Python 2, i.e. ""2.7.18+"" (plus 3.9 and 3.10), with the plus meaning (at least some) ""backported security updates"".[55]
In 2021 (and again twice in 2022), security updates were expedited, since all Python versions were insecure (including 2.7[56]) because of security issues leading to possible remote code execution[57] and web-cache poisoning.[58] In 2022, Python 3.10.4 and 3.9.12 were expedited[59] and 3.8.13, because of many security issues.[60] When Python 3.9.13 was released in May 2022, it was announced that the 3.9 series (joining the older series 3.8 and 3.7) would only receive security fixes in the future.[61] On 7 September 2022, four new releases were made due to a potential denial-of-service attack: 3.10.7, 3.9.14, 3.8.14, and 3.7.14.[62][63]
As of October 2023, Python 3.12 is the stable release, and 3.12 and 3.11 are the only versions with active (as opposed to just security) support. Notable changes in 3.11 from 3.10 include increased program execution speed and improved error reporting.[64]
Python 3.12 adds syntax (and in fact every Python since at least 3.5 adds some syntax) to the language, the new (soft) keyword type (recent releases have added a lot of typing support e.g. new type union operator in 3.10), and 3.11 for exception handling, and 3.10 the match and case (soft) keywords, for structural pattern matching statements. Python 3.12 also drops outdated modules and functionality, and future versions will too, see below in Development section.
Python 3.11 claims to be between 10 and 60% faster than Python 3.10, and Python 3.12 adds another 5% on top of that. It also has improved error messages, and many other changes.
Since 27 June 2023, Python 3.8 is the oldest supported version of Python (albeit in the 'security support' phase), due to Python 3.7 reaching end-of-life.[65]
Python 3.13 has a garbage collector which is now incremental (can mean much shorter pauses), and has an experimental JIT compiler;[66] and it removes from the C API (and removes some standard library modules, 19 dead batteries, and many deprecated classes, functions and methods, and more will be removed in Python 3.15 and or 3.16).[67] Starting with 3.13, it and later versions have 2 years of full support (up from one and a half); followed by 3 years of security support (for same total support as before).","For data analysis, reporting and business intelligence use cases - how has Python adoption for these expanded over 5-10 years?",False,"I cannot answer this question as the context provided does not contain information about Python's adoption for data analysis, reporting, or business intelligence use cases over the last 5-10 years.",grounded_correct,"The context you've provided does not include any information about Python's adoption for data analysis, reporting, and business intelligence use cases over the last 10 years.

History[edit]

The designer of Python, Guido van Rossum, at OSCON 2006
Main article: History of Python
Python was invented in the late 1980s[41] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[42] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[11] Its implementation began in December 1989.[43] Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his ""permanent vacation"" from his responsibilities as Python's ""benevolent dictator for life"" (BDFL), a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker[44] (he's since come out of retirement and is self-titled ""BDFL-emeritus""). In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.[45][46]
Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support.[47] Python 3.0, released on 3 December 2008, with many of its major features backported to Python 2.6.x[48] and 2.7.x. Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.[49]
Python 2.7's end-of-life was initially set for 2015, then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.[50][51] No further security patches or other improvements will be released for it.[52][53] Currently only 3.8 and later are supported (2023 security issues were fixed in e.g. 3.7.17, the final 3.7.x release[54]). While Python 2.7 and older is officially unsupported, a different unofficial Python implementation, PyPy, continues to support Python 2, i.e. ""2.7.18+"" (plus 3.9 and 3.10), with the plus meaning (at least some) ""backported security updates"".[55]
In 2021 (and again twice in 2022), security updates were expedited, since all Python versions were insecure (including 2.7[56]) because of security issues leading to possible remote code execution[57] and web-cache poisoning.[58] In 2022, Python 3.10.4 and 3.9.12 were expedited[59] and 3.8.13, because of many security issues.[60] When Python 3.9.13 was released in May 2022, it was announced that the 3.9 series (joining the older series 3.8 and 3.7) would only receive security fixes in the future.[61] On 7 September 2022, four new releases were made due to a potential denial-of-service attack: 3.10.7, 3.9.14, 3.8.14, and 3.7.14.[62][63]
As of October 2023, Python 3.12 is the stable release, and 3.12 and 3.11 are the only versions with active (as opposed to just security) support. Notable changes in 3.11 from 3.10 include increased program execution speed and improved error reporting.[64]
Python 3.12 adds syntax (and in fact every Python since at least 3.5 adds some syntax) to the language, the new (soft) keyword type (recent releases have added a lot of typing support e.g. new type union operator in 3.10), and 3.11 for exception handling, and 3.10 the match and case (soft) keywords, for structural pattern matching statements. Python 3.12 also drops outdated modules and functionality, and future versions will too, see below in Development section.
Python 3.11 claims to be between 10 and 60% faster than Python 3.10, and Python 3.12 adds another 5% on top of that. It also has improved error messages, and many other changes.
Since 27 June 2023, Python 3.8 is the oldest supported version of Python (albeit in the 'security support' phase), due to Python 3.7 reaching end-of-life.[65]
Python 3.13 has a garbage collector which is now incremental (can mean much shorter pauses), and has an experimental JIT compiler;[66] and it removes from the C API (and removes some standard library modules, 19 dead batteries, and many deprecated classes, functions and methods, and more will be removed in Python 3.15 and or 3.16).[67] Starting with 3.13, it and later versions have 2 years of full support (up from one and a half); followed by 3 years of security support (for same total support as before).",How does Python's concurrency and parallelism story compare to other languages?

Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages and has gained widespread use in the machine learning community.

While Java and Go are also popular programming languages, they have different design philosophies and features. Java is known for its robustness, scalability, and maturity, and is often used for enterprise applications and large-scale systems. Go, on the other hand, is known for its simplicity, concurrency, and performance, and is popular for developing cloud-native applications and microservices.

In terms of speed and scalability, both Java and Go can perform well, depending on the specific application and workload. Java is often considered faster than Python due to its just-in-time (JIT) compiler, which can optimize bytecode at runtime. Go, on the other hand, has a runtime system that allows for efficient parallel processing and low-latency communication, making it well-suited for distributed computing and cloud-native applications.

History[edit]

Main article: History of Python
Python was invented in the late 1980s[41] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[42] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[11] Its implementation began in December 1989.[43] Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his ""permanent vacation"" from his responsibilities as Python's ""benevolent dictator for life"" (BDFL), a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker[44] (he's since come out of retirement and is self-titled ""BDFL-emeritus""). In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.[45][46]
Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support.[47] Python 3.0, released on 3 December 2008, with many of its major features backported to Python 2.6.x[48] and 2.7.x. Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.[49]
Python 2.7's end-of-life was initially set for 2015, then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.[50][51] No further security patches or other improvements will be released for it.[52][53] Currently only 3.8 and later are supported (2023 security issues were fixed in e.g. 3.7.17, the final 3.7.x release[54]). While Python 2.7 and older is officially unsupported, a different unofficial Python implementation, PyPy, continues to support Python 2, i.e. ""2.7.18+"" (plus 3.9 and 3.10), with the plus meaning (at least some) ""backported security updates"".[55]
In 2021 (and again twice in 2022), security updates were expedited, since all Python versions were insecure (including 2.7[56]) because of security issues leading to possible remote code execution[57] and web-cache poisoning.[58] In 2022, Python 3.10.4 and 3.9.12 were expedited[59] and 3.8.13, because of many security issues.[60] When Python 3.9.13 was released in May 2022, it was announced that the 3.9 series (joining the older series 3.8 and 3.7) would only receive security fixes in the future.[61] On 7 September 2022, four new releases were made due to a potential denial-of-service attack: 3.10.7, 3.9.14, 3.8.14, and 3.7.14.[62][63]
As of October 2023, Python 3.12 is the stable release, and 3.12 and 3.11 are the only versions with active (as opposed to just security) support. Notable changes in 3.11 from 3.10 include increased program execution speed and improved error reporting.[64]
Python 3.12 adds syntax (and in fact every Python since at least 3.5 adds some syntax) to the language, the new (soft) keyword type (recent releases have added a lot of typing support e.g. new type union operator in 3.10), and 3.11 for exception handling, and 3.10 the match and case (soft) keywords, for structural pattern matching statements. Python 3.12 also drops outdated modules and functionality, and future versions will too, see below in Development section.
Python 3.11 claims to be between 10 and 60% faster than Python 3.10, and Python 3.12 adds another 5% on top of that. It also has improved error messages, and many other changes.
Since 27 June 2023, Python 3.8 is the oldest supported version of Python (albeit in the 'security support' phase), due to Python 3.7 reaching end-of-life.[65]
Python 3.13 has a garbage collector which is now incremental (can mean much shorter pauses), and has an experimental JIT compiler;[66] and it removes from the C API (and removes some standard library modules, 19 dead batteries, and many deprecated classes, functions and methods, and more will be removed in Python 3.15 and or 3.16).[67] Starting with 3.13, it and later versions have 2 years of full support (up from one and a half); followed by 3 years of security support (for same total support as before).","Which operating systems, hardware platforms or specific use cases represent the biggest shortcomings or challenges for Python currently?",False,"I cannot answer this question as the context does not provide information about specific challenges or shortcomings related to operating systems, hardware platforms, or use cases for Python.",grounded_correct,"I cannot find any specific details within the context provided about the biggest shortcomings or challenges for Python with regard to operating systems, hardware platforms, or specific use cases.

Python encourages code readability and has a comprehensive standard library, which can aid in writing maintainable code. The ""batteries included"" philosophy means many common tasks can be accomplished without needing to add external libraries.

For testing, Python's standard library includes the `unittest` module, and there are also popular third-party libraries like `pytest` and `nose`. These tools can help ensure code reliability and maintainability by making it easier to write and run tests.

Documentation in Python can be written using reStructuredText and included in docstrings within the code. Tools like Sphinx can then generate HTML pages from the docstrings, making it easy to create and maintain documentation alongside the code.

The Python community emphasizes the importance of testing, maintainability, and documentation for Python code. There are several tools and best practices that help achieve these goals.

For testing, Python has a robust testing framework called unittest that allows developers to write and run test cases. The unittest framework provides a variety of assertion methods and supports test automation. Additionally, there are third-party testing tools such as pytest and tox that extend the capabilities of unittest and make testing easier.

Maintainability is also emphasized in Python. The language's design philosophy includes features such as indentation-based syntax, which makes code readable and easier to maintain. Python also supports modular programming, which allows developers to break down large projects into smaller, reusable components.

Documentation is crucial in Python, and there are several tools and practices that help with documentation. The most popular documentation tool for Python is Sphinx, which allows developers to write documentation in reStructuredText format and generate web pages, PDFs, and other documentation formats. Sphinx also supports autodocumentation, which generates documentation from the code itself.

History[edit]

The designer of Python, Guido van Rossum, at OSCON 2006
Main article: History of Python
Python was invented in the late 1980s[41] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[42] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[11] Its implementation began in December 1989.[43] Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his ""permanent vacation"" from his responsibilities as Python's ""benevolent dictator for life"" (BDFL), a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker[44] (he's since come out of retirement and is self-titled ""BDFL-emeritus""). In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.[45][46]
Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support.[47] Python 3.0, released on 3 December 2008, with many of its major features backported to Python 2.6.x[48] and 2.7.x. Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.[49]
Python 2.7's end-of-life was initially set for 2015, then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.[50][51] No further security patches or other improvements will be released for it.[52][53] Currently only 3.8 and later are supported (2023 security issues were fixed in e.g. 3.7.17, the final 3.7.x release[54]). While Python 2.7 and older is officially unsupported, a different unofficial Python implementation, PyPy, continues to support Python 2, i.e. ""2.7.18+"" (plus 3.9 and 3.10), with the plus meaning (at least some) ""backported security updates"".[55]
In 2021 (and again twice in 2022), security updates were expedited, since all Python versions were insecure (including 2.7[56]) because of security issues leading to possible remote code execution[57] and web-cache poisoning.[58] In 2022, Python 3.10.4 and 3.9.12 were expedited[59] and 3.8.13, because of many security issues.[60] When Python 3.9.13 was released in May 2022, it was announced that the 3.9 series (joining the older series 3.8 and 3.7) would only receive security fixes in the future.[61] On 7 September 2022, four new releases were made due to a potential denial-of-service attack: 3.10.7, 3.9.14, 3.8.14, and 3.7.14.[62][63]
As of October 2023, Python 3.12 is the stable release, and 3.12 and 3.11 are the only versions with active (as opposed to just security) support. Notable changes in 3.11 from 3.10 include increased program execution speed and improved error reporting.[64]
Python 3.12 adds syntax (and in fact every Python since at least 3.5 adds some syntax) to the language, the new (soft) keyword type (recent releases have added a lot of typing support e.g. new type union operator in 3.10), and 3.11 for exception handling, and 3.10 the match and case (soft) keywords, for structural pattern matching statements. Python 3.12 also drops outdated modules and functionality, and future versions will too, see below in Development section.
Python 3.11 claims to be between 10 and 60% faster than Python 3.10, and Python 3.12 adds another 5% on top of that. It also has improved error messages, and many other changes.

As of October 2023, Python 3.12 is the stable release, and 3.12 and 3.11 are the only versions with active (as opposed to just security) support. Notable changes in 3.11 from 3.10 include increased program execution speed and improved error reporting.[64]
Python 3.12 adds syntax (and in fact every Python since at least 3.5 adds some syntax) to the language, the new (soft) keyword type (recent releases have added a lot of typing support e.g. new type union operator in 3.10), and 3.11 for exception handling, and 3.10 the match and case (soft) keywords, for structural pattern matching statements. Python 3.12 also drops outdated modules and functionality, and future versions will too, see below in Development section.
Python 3.11 claims to be between 10 and 60% faster than Python 3.10, and Python 3.12 adds another 5% on top of that. It also has improved error messages, and many other changes.

Python was invented in the late 1980s[41] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[42] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[11] Its implementation began in December 1989.[43] Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his ""permanent vacation"" from his responsibilities as Python's ""benevolent dictator for life"" (BDFL), a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker[44] (he's since come out of retirement and is self-titled ""BDFL-emeritus""). In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.[45][46]

History[edit]

The designer of Python, Guido van Rossum, at OSCON 2006
Main article: History of Python
Python was invented in the late 1980s[41] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[42] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[11] Its implementation began in December 1989.[43] Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his ""permanent vacation"" from his responsibilities as Python's ""benevolent dictator for life"" (BDFL), a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker[44] (he's since come out of retirement and is self-titled ""BDFL-emeritus""). In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.[45][46]
Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support.[47] Python 3.0, released on 3 December 2008, with many of its major features backported to Python 2.6.x[48] and 2.7.x. Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.[49]
Python 2.7's end-of-life was initially set for 2015, then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.[50][51] No further security patches or other improvements will be released for it.[52][53] Currently only 3.8 and later are supported (2023 security issues were fixed in e.g. 3.7.17, the final 3.7.x release[54]). While Python 2.7 and older is officially unsupported, a different unofficial Python implementation, PyPy, continues to support Python 2, i.e. ""2.7.18+"" (plus 3.9 and 3.10), with the plus meaning (at least some) ""backported security updates"".[55]
In 2021 (and again twice in 2022), security updates were expedited, since all Python versions were insecure (including 2.7[56]) because of security issues leading to possible remote code execution[57] and web-cache poisoning.[58] In 2022, Python 3.10.4 and 3.9.12 were expedited[59] and 3.8.13, because of many security issues.[60] When Python 3.9.13 was released in May 2022, it was announced that the 3.9 series (joining the older series 3.8 and 3.7) would only receive security fixes in the future.[61] On 7 September 2022, four new releases were made due to a potential denial-of-service attack: 3.10.7, 3.9.14, 3.8.14, and 3.7.14.[62][63]
As of October 2023, Python 3.12 is the stable release, and 3.12 and 3.11 are the only versions with active (as opposed to just security) support. Notable changes in 3.11 from 3.10 include increased program execution speed and improved error reporting.[64]
Python 3.12 adds syntax (and in fact every Python since at least 3.5 adds some syntax) to the language, the new (soft) keyword type (recent releases have added a lot of typing support e.g. new type union operator in 3.10), and 3.11 for exception handling, and 3.10 the match and case (soft) keywords, for structural pattern matching statements. Python 3.12 also drops outdated modules and functionality, and future versions will too, see below in Development section.
Python 3.11 claims to be between 10 and 60% faster than Python 3.10, and Python 3.12 adds another 5% on top of that. It also has improved error messages, and many other changes.
Since 27 June 2023, Python 3.8 is the oldest supported version of Python (albeit in the 'security support' phase), due to Python 3.7 reaching end-of-life.[65]
Python 3.13 has a garbage collector which is now incremental (can mean much shorter pauses), and has an experimental JIT compiler;[66] and it removes from the C API (and removes some standard library modules, 19 dead batteries, and many deprecated classes, functions and methods, and more will be removed in Python 3.15 and or 3.16).[67] Starting with 3.13, it and later versions have 2 years of full support (up from one and a half); followed by 3 years of security support (for same total support as before).","For cloud deployments, serverless environments and containers - how turnkey is Python compared to alternatives?",False,"I cannot answer this question as the context provided does not contain information about cloud deployments, serverless environments, or containers in relation to Python.",grounded_correct,"The context provided does not include any information about cloud deployments, serverless environments, or containers, and therefore I cannot answer your question about Python's turnkey nature in those contexts. Sorry about that!",grounded_correct,"```
I can answer this question briefly based on the context. Python is a popular programming language, and its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. It is often described as a ""batteries included"" language due to its comprehensive standard library. Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages, and has gained widespread use in the machine learning community.

Regarding the question, Python is a turnkey language for cloud deployments, serverless environments, and containers. It has a comprehensive standard library that includes modules for working with cloud services, such as AWS and Google Cloud, as well as modules for working with containers, such as Docker. Additionally, Python has a large and active community, which means there are many pre-built packages and tools available for working with cloud deployments, serverless environments, and containers.

However, it's worth noting that Python is not the only language that is well-suited for cloud deployments, serverless environments, and containers. Other languages, such as Java and Node.js, also have a strong presence in these areas. Ultimately, the choice of language will depend on the specific needs and requirements of the project.

History[edit]

The designer of Python, Guido van Rossum, at OSCON 2006
Main article: History of Python
Python was invented in the late 1980s[41] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[42] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[11] Its implementation began in December 1989.[43] Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his ""permanent vacation"" from his responsibilities as Python's ""benevolent dictator for life"" (BDFL), a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker[44] (he's since come out of retirement and is self-titled ""BDFL-emeritus""). In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.[45][46]
Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support.[47] Python 3.0, released on 3 December 2008, with many of its major features backported to Python 2.6.x[48] and 2.7.x. Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.[49]
Python 2.7's end-of-life was initially set for 2015, then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.[50][51] No further security patches or other improvements will be released for it.[52][53] Currently only 3.8 and later are supported (2023 security issues were fixed in e.g. 3.7.17, the final 3.7.x release[54]). While Python 2.7 and older is officially unsupported, a different unofficial Python implementation, PyPy, continues to support Python 2, i.e. ""2.7.18+"" (plus 3.9 and 3.10), with the plus meaning (at least some) ""backported security updates"".[55]
In 2021 (and again twice in 2022), security updates were expedited, since all Python versions were insecure (including 2.7[56]) because of security issues leading to possible remote code execution[57] and web-cache poisoning.[58] In 2022, Python 3.10.4 and 3.9.12 were expedited[59] and 3.8.13, because of many security issues.[60] When Python 3.9.13 was released in May 2022, it was announced that the 3.9 series (joining the older series 3.8 and 3.7) would only receive security fixes in the future.[61] On 7 September 2022, four new releases were made due to a potential denial-of-service attack: 3.10.7, 3.9.14, 3.8.14, and 3.7.14.[62][63]
As of October 2023, Python 3.12 is the stable release, and 3.12 and 3.11 are the only versions with active (as opposed to just security) support. Notable changes in 3.11 from 3.10 include increased program execution speed and improved error reporting.[64]
Python 3.12 adds syntax (and in fact every Python since at least 3.5 adds some syntax) to the language, the new (soft) keyword type (recent releases have added a lot of typing support e.g. new type union operator in 3.10), and 3.11 for exception handling, and 3.10 the match and case (soft) keywords, for structural pattern matching statements. Python 3.12 also drops outdated modules and functionality, and future versions will too, see below in Development section.
Python 3.11 claims to be between 10 and 60% faster than Python 3.10, and Python 3.12 adds another 5% on top of that. It also has improved error messages, and many other changes.
Since 27 June 2023, Python 3.8 is the oldest supported version of Python (albeit in the 'security support' phase), due to Python 3.7 reaching end-of-life.[65]
Python 3.13 has a garbage collector which is now incremental (can mean much shorter pauses), and has an experimental JIT compiler;[66] and it removes from the C API (and removes some standard library modules, 19 dead batteries, and many deprecated classes, functions and methods, and more will be removed in Python 3.15 and or 3.16).[67] Starting with 3.13, it and later versions have 2 years of full support (up from one and a half); followed by 3 years of security support (for same total support as before).",How have Python scientific computing and numeric analysis libraries evolved to suit big data use cases and high performance needs?,False,I cannot answer this question as the context provided does not contain any information about the evolution of Python's scientific computing and numeric analysis libraries for big data use cases and high-performance needs.,grounded_correct,"The context provided does not offer any specific information about Python's scientific computing and numeric analysis libraries and how they have evolved to suit big data use cases and high-performance needs.

In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.[45][46]
Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support.[47] Python 3.0, released on 3 December 2008, with many of its major features backported to Python 2.6.x[48] and 2.7.x. Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.[49]
Python 2.7's end-of-life was initially set for 2015, then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.[50][51] No further security patches or other improvements will be released for it.[52][53] Currently only 3.8 and later are supported (2023 security issues were fixed in e.g. 3.7.17, the final 3.7.x release[54]). While Python 2.7 and older is officially unsupported, a different unofficial Python implementation, PyPy, continues to support Python 2, i.e. ""2.7.18+"" (plus 3.9 and 3.10), with the plus meaning (at least some) ""backported security updates"".[55]
In 2021 (and again twice in 2022), security updates were expedited, since all Python versions were insecure (including 2.7[56]) because of security issues leading to possible remote code execution[57] and web-cache poisoning.[58] In 2022, Python 3.10.4 and 3.9.12 were expedited[59] and 3.8.13, because of many security issues.[60] When Python 3.9.13 was released in May 2022, it was announced that the 3.9 series (joining the older series 3.8 and 3.7) would only receive security fixes in the future.[61] On 7 September 2022, four new releases were made due to a potential denial-of-service attack: 3.10.7, 3.9.14, 3.8.14, and 3.7.14.[62][63]
As of October 2023, Python 3.12 is the stable release, and 3.12 and 3.11 are the only versions with active (as opposed to just security) support. Notable changes in 3.11 from 3.10 include increased program execution speed and improved error reporting.[64]
Python 3.12 adds syntax (and in fact every Python since at least 3.5 adds some syntax) to the language, the new (soft) keyword type (recent releases have added a lot of typing support e.g. new type union operator in 3.10), and 3.11 for exception handling, and 3.10 the match and case (soft) keywords, for structural pattern matching statements. Python 3.12 also drops outdated modules and functionality, and future versions will too, see below in Development section.
Python 3.11 claims to be between 10 and 60% faster than Python 3.10, and Python 3.12 adds another 5% on top of that. It also has improved error messages, and many other changes.
Since 27 June 2023, Python 3.8 is the oldest supported version of Python (albeit in the 'security support' phase), due to Python 3.7 reaching end-of-life.[65]
Python 3.13 has a garbage collector which is now incremental (can mean much shorter pauses), and has an experimental JIT compiler;[66] and it removes from the C API (and removes some standard library modules, 19 dead batteries, and many deprecated classes, functions and methods, and more will be removed in Python 3.15 and or 3.16).[67] Starting with 3.13, it and later versions have 2 years of full support (up from one and a half); followed by 3 years of security support (for same total support as before).",What future directions or growth areas do Python's core developers have planned for upcoming 4.x or even 5.x releases in terms of language features?,False,I cannot answer this question as the context provided does not include information about the future direction or growth areas for Python's 4.x or 5.x releases.,grounded_correct,"According to the context, Python's core developers have focused on adding new syntax and improving the performance, error reporting, and garbage collection mechanisms of the language in the recent 3.x releases.

History[edit]

The designer of Python, Guido van Rossum, at OSCON 2006
Main article: History of Python
Python was invented in the late 1980s[41] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[42] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[11] Its implementation began in December 1989.[43] Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his ""permanent vacation"" from his responsibilities as Python's ""benevolent dictator for life"" (BDFL), a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker[44] (he's since come out of retirement and is self-titled ""BDFL-emeritus""). In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.[45][46]
Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support.[47] Python 3.0, released on 3 December 2008, with many of its major features backported to Python 2.6.x[48] and 2.7.x. Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.[49]
Python 2.7's end-of-life was initially set for 2015, then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.[50][51] No further security patches or other improvements will be released for it.[52][53] Currently only 3.8 and later are supported (2023 security issues were fixed in e.g. 3.7.17, the final 3.7.x release[54]). While Python 2.7 and older is officially unsupported, a different unofficial Python implementation, PyPy, continues to support Python 2, i.e. ""2.7.18+"" (plus 3.9 and 3.10), with the plus meaning (at least some) ""backported security updates"".[55]
In 2021 (and again twice in 2022), security updates were expedited, since all Python versions were insecure (including 2.7[56]) because of security issues leading to possible remote code execution[57] and web-cache poisoning.[58] In 2022, Python 3.10.4 and 3.9.12 were expedited[59] and 3.8.13, because of many security issues.[60] When Python 3.9.13 was released in May 2022, it was announced that the 3.9 series (joining the older series 3.8 and 3.7) would only receive security fixes in the future.[61] On 7 September 2022, four new releases were made due to a potential denial-of-service attack: 3.10.7, 3.9.14, 3.8.14, and 3.7.14.[62][63]
As of October 2023, Python 3.12 is the stable release, and 3.12 and 3.11 are the only versions with active (as opposed to just security) support. Notable changes in 3.11 from 3.10 include increased program execution speed and improved error reporting.[64]
Python 3.12 adds syntax (and in fact every Python since at least 3.5 adds some syntax) to the language, the new (soft) keyword type (recent releases have added a lot of typing support e.g. new type union operator in 3.10), and 3.11 for exception handling, and 3.10 the match and case (soft) keywords, for structural pattern matching statements. Python 3.12 also drops outdated modules and functionality, and future versions will too, see below in Development section.
Python 3.11 claims to be between 10 and 60% faster than Python 3.10, and Python 3.12 adds another 5% on top of that. It also has improved error messages, and many other changes.
Since 27 June 2023, Python 3.8 is the oldest supported version of Python (albeit in the 'security support' phase), due to Python 3.7 reaching end-of-life.[65]
Python 3.13 has a garbage collector which is now incremental (can mean much shorter pauses), and has an experimental JIT compiler;[66] and it removes from the C API (and removes some standard library modules, 19 dead batteries, and many deprecated classes, functions and methods, and more will be removed in Python 3.15 and or 3.16).[67] Starting with 3.13, it and later versions have 2 years of full support (up from one and a half); followed by 3 years of security support (for same total support as before).",How does Python's dynamic typing and duck typing compare to statically typed languages like Java or C++? What are the tradeoffs?,False,"I can briefly explain the comparison and trade-offs between Python's dynamic typing and duck typing against static typing in languages like Java or C++. 

Dynamic typing in Python means that the type of a variable is determined at runtime, offering flexibility and ease of writing code. This contrasts with static typing in Java or C++, where variable types are fixed and determined during compilation, offering stronger type safety and easier debugging. 

Duck typing in Python refers to the concept of determining a method's suitability for an object based on the presence of required methods or attributes, providing more flexibility in code design. 

Trade-offs include the ease of writing and modifying code in dynamically typed languages like Python versus stronger type safety and performance optimizations in statically typed languages.",ungrounded_correct,"Python's dynamic typing allows for more flexibility in code development, as developers don't have to specify the type of data a variable will hold. This makes the language more dynamic and adaptable but can potentially lead to errors if not managed carefully. 

In comparison, statically typed languages like Java or C++ require explicit type declarations, providing more structure and static analysis capabilities but can be more rigid and require more upfront planning.

The tradeoff between dynamic and static typing revolves around flexibility versus predictability and compile-time error detection. Dynamic typing offers freedom to develop and experiment but may have a higher risk of runtime errors. Conversely, static typing provides stronger type safety and easier debugging but can be more time-consuming and restrictive.",ungrounded_correct,"```
I can answer this question briefly based on the context. 

Python is dynamically typed, which means that the data type of a variable is determined at runtime, not at compile time. This is in contrast to statically typed languages like Java or C++ where the data type of a variable is determined at compile time. 

The tradeoff is that dynamically typed languages like Python are more flexible and easier to use, but may also be more prone to errors at runtime. Statically typed languages like Java or C++ are more rigid and require more explicit type definitions, but are generally more robust and less prone to errors at runtime.

I cannot answer this question as it is asking for a comparison with languages outside of the provided context. The context only provides information about Python and does not mention Java or C++. I can only answer questions within the scope of the provided context.
```",grounded_correct," Python is dynamically typed and supports both dynamic and static typing through optional type hints. This means that the data type of a variable is determined at runtime, unlike in statically typed languages such as Java or C++ where the data type is determined at compile time.

The main advantage of dynamic typing is that it allows for more flexibility and faster development, as the programmer does not need to explicitly declare the data types of variables. However, it can also lead to potential errors, such as type mismatches, that may not be caught until runtime.

On the other hand, static typing provides stricter type checking at compile time, which can help catch errors earlier in the development process and improve code reliability. However, it can also add extra development time and complexity, as the programmer needs to explicitly declare the data types of all variables.

The tradeoffs between dynamic and static typing depend on the specific use case and development preferences. Python's approach of supporting both allows developers to choose the typing approach that best fits their needs.",ungrounded_correct," In contrast to statically typed languages like Java or C++, Python is dynamically typed and uses duck typing, which means that an object's methods and properties determine its type, rather than its declaration. The main advantage of dynamic typing in Python is simpler, more concise code and faster development time. However, tradeoffs include potentially less efficient runtime performance and the possibility of runtime errors due to type mismatches. Statically typed languages like Java and C++ offer stronger type safety and better performance but usually require more time for development due to explicit type declarations and longer compile-time checks.",ungrounded_correct,"Python, as mentioned in the context, is dynamically typed, which means the type is checked during runtime. This is different from statically typed languages like Java or C++ where type checking happens at compile-time.

Duck typing in Python is a programming concept that allows an object's methods and properties to determine its type, rather than its class (i.e., if it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck).

The trade-offs between dynamic/duck typing and static typing include:

1. Flexibility: Dynamic and duck typing in Python offer more flexibility, allowing for easier experimentation and prototyping. Static typing in Java or C++ provides more strictness, which can help catch errors early in the development process.

2. Readability and Maintainability: Statically typed languages can be easier to read and maintain because variable types are explicitly defined. However, Python's emphasis on code readability can mitigate this to some extent.

3. Performance: Statically typed languages often have a performance advantage because type checking happens before the program runs.",ungrounded_correct,"The provided context does not contain any information comparing Python's dynamic typing and duck typing to statically typed languages like Java or C++, or discussing the tradeoffs between them.

Python's dynamic typing and duck typing allow for more flexibility and ease of development, but they can also make it harder to catch errors at compile-time and may result in slower performance.

History[edit]

Main article: History of Python
Python was invented in the late 1980s[41] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[42] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[11] Its implementation began in December 1989.[43] Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his ""permanent vacation"" from his responsibilities as Python's ""benevolent dictator for life"" (BDFL), a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker[44] (he's since come out of retirement and is self-titled ""BDFL-emeritus""). In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.[45][46]
Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support.[47] Python 3.0, released on 3 December 2008, with many of its major features backported to Python 2.6.x[48] and 2.7.x. Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.[49]
Python 2.7's end-of-life was initially set for 2015, then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.[50][51] No further security patches or other improvements will be released for it.[52][53] Currently only 3.8 and later are supported (2023 security issues were fixed in e.g. 3.7.17, the final 3.7.x release[54]). While Python 2.7 and older is officially unsupported, a different unofficial Python implementation, PyPy, continues to support Python 2, i.e. ""2.7.18+"" (plus 3.9 and 3.10), with the plus meaning (at least some) ""backported security updates"".[55]
In 2021 (and again twice in 2022), security updates were expedited, since all Python versions were insecure (including 2.7[56]) because of security issues leading to possible remote code execution[57] and web-cache poisoning.[58] In 2022, Python 3.10.4 and 3.9.12 were expedited[59] and 3.8.13, because of many security issues.[60] When Python 3.9.13 was released in May 2022, it was announced that the 3.9 series (joining the older series 3.8 and 3.7) would only receive security fixes in the future.[61] On 7 September 2022, four new releases were made due to a potential denial-of-service attack: 3.10.7, 3.9.14, 3.8.14, and 3.7.14.[62][63]
As of October 2023, Python 3.12 is the stable release, and 3.12 and 3.11 are the only versions with active (as opposed to just security) support. Notable changes in 3.11 from 3.10 include increased program execution speed and improved error reporting.[64]
Python 3.12 adds syntax (and in fact every Python since at least 3.5 adds some syntax) to the language, the new (soft) keyword type (recent releases have added a lot of typing support e.g. new type union operator in 3.10), and 3.11 for exception handling, and 3.10 the match and case (soft) keywords, for structural pattern matching statements. Python 3.12 also drops outdated modules and functionality, and future versions will too, see below in Development section.

History[edit]

The designer of Python, Guido van Rossum, at OSCON 2006
Main article: History of Python
Python was invented in the late 1980s[41] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[42] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[11] Its implementation began in December 1989.[43] Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his ""permanent vacation"" from his responsibilities as Python's ""benevolent dictator for life"" (BDFL), a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker[44] (he's since come out of retirement and is self-titled ""BDFL-emeritus""). In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.[45][46]
Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support.[47] Python 3.0, released on 3 December 2008, with many of its major features backported to Python 2.6.x[48] and 2.7.x. Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.[49]
Python 2.7's end-of-life was initially set for 2015, then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.[50][51] No further security patches or other improvements will be released for it.[52][53] Currently only 3.8 and later are supported (2023 security issues were fixed in e.g. 3.7.17, the final 3.7.x release[54]). While Python 2.7 and older is officially unsupported, a different unofficial Python implementation, PyPy, continues to support Python 2, i.e. ""2.7.18+"" (plus 3.9 and 3.10), with the plus meaning (at least some) ""backported security updates"".[55]
In 2021 (and again twice in 2022), security updates were expedited, since all Python versions were insecure (including 2.7[56]) because of security issues leading to possible remote code execution[57] and web-cache poisoning.[58] In 2022, Python 3.10.4 and 3.9.12 were expedited[59] and 3.8.13, because of many security issues.[60] When Python 3.9.13 was released in May 2022, it was announced that the 3.9 series (joining the older series 3.8 and 3.7) would only receive security fixes in the future.[61] On 7 September 2022, four new releases were made due to a potential denial-of-service attack: 3.10.7, 3.9.14, 3.8.14, and 3.7.14.[62][63]
As of October 2023, Python 3.12 is the stable release, and 3.12 and 3.11 are the only versions with active (as opposed to just security) support. Notable changes in 3.11 from 3.10 include increased program execution speed and improved error reporting.[64]
Python 3.12 adds syntax (and in fact every Python since at least 3.5 adds some syntax) to the language, the new (soft) keyword type (recent releases have added a lot of typing support e.g. new type union operator in 3.10), and 3.11 for exception handling, and 3.10 the match and case (soft) keywords, for structural pattern matching statements. Python 3.12 also drops outdated modules and functionality, and future versions will too, see below in Development section.
Python 3.11 claims to be between 10 and 60% faster than Python 3.10, and Python 3.12 adds another 5% on top of that. It also has improved error messages, and many other changes.
Since 27 June 2023, Python 3.8 is the oldest supported version of Python (albeit in the 'security support' phase), due to Python 3.7 reaching end-of-life.[65]
Python 3.13 has a garbage collector which is now incremental (can mean much shorter pauses), and has an experimental JIT compiler;[66] and it removes from the C API (and removes some standard library modules, 19 dead batteries, and many deprecated classes, functions and methods, and more will be removed in Python 3.15 and or 3.16).[67] Starting with 3.13, it and later versions have 2 years of full support (up from one and a half); followed by 3 years of security support (for same total support as before).","When were Python 2.0 and Python 3.0 released, and what were some of their major features?",True,"Python 2.0 was released on October 16, 2000, and Python 3.0 was released on December 3, 2008. 

Python 2.0's major features included list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support.

Since 27 June 2023, Python 3.8 is the oldest supported version of Python (albeit in the 'security support' phase), due to Python 3.7 reaching end-of-life.[65]
Python 3.13 has a garbage collector which is now incremental (can mean much shorter pauses), and has an experimental JIT compiler;[66] and it removes from the C API (and removes some standard library modules, 19 dead batteries, and many deprecated classes, functions and methods, and more will be removed in Python 3.15 and or 3.16).[67] Starting with 3.13, it and later versions have 2 years of full support (up from one and a half); followed by 3 years of security support (for same total support as before).","How popular is Python among programming languages, and in what field has it gained widespread use?",True,Python is one of the most popular programming languages and is widely used in the machine learning community.,grounded_correct,"Based on the context, Python is one of the most popular programming languages.

History[edit]

The designer of Python, Guido van Rossum, at OSCON 2006
Main article: History of Python
Python was invented in the late 1980s[41] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[42] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[11] Its implementation began in December 1989.[43] Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his ""permanent vacation"" from his responsibilities as Python's ""benevolent dictator for life"" (BDFL), a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker[44] (he's since come out of retirement and is self-titled ""BDFL-emeritus""). In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.[45][46]
Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support.[47] Python 3.0, released on 3 December 2008, with many of its major features backported to Python 2.6.x[48] and 2.7.x. Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.[49]
Python 2.7's end-of-life was initially set for 2015, then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.[50][51] No further security patches or other improvements will be released for it.[52][53] Currently only 3.8 and later are supported (2023 security issues were fixed in e.g. 3.7.17, the final 3.7.x release[54]). While Python 2.7 and older is officially unsupported, a different unofficial Python implementation, PyPy, continues to support Python 2, i.e. ""2.7.18+"" (plus 3.9 and 3.10), with the plus meaning (at least some) ""backported security updates"".[55]
In 2021 (and again twice in 2022), security updates were expedited, since all Python versions were insecure (including 2.7[56]) because of security issues leading to possible remote code execution[57] and web-cache poisoning.[58] In 2022, Python 3.10.4 and 3.9.12 were expedited[59] and 3.8.13, because of many security issues.[60] When Python 3.9.13 was released in May 2022, it was announced that the 3.9 series (joining the older series 3.8 and 3.7) would only receive security fixes in the future.[61] On 7 September 2022, four new releases were made due to a potential denial-of-service attack: 3.10.7, 3.9.14, 3.8.14, and 3.7.14.[62][63]
As of October 2023, Python 3.12 is the stable release, and 3.12 and 3.11 are the only versions with active (as opposed to just security) support. Notable changes in 3.11 from 3.10 include increased program execution speed and improved error reporting.[64]
Python 3.12 adds syntax (and in fact every Python since at least 3.5 adds some syntax) to the language, the new (soft) keyword type (recent releases have added a lot of typing support e.g. new type union operator in 3.10), and 3.11 for exception handling, and 3.10 the match and case (soft) keywords, for structural pattern matching statements. Python 3.12 also drops outdated modules and functionality, and future versions will too, see below in Development section.
Python 3.11 claims to be between 10 and 60% faster than Python 3.10, and Python 3.12 adds another 5% on top of that. It also has improved error messages, and many other changes.

"Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.[32]
Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a ""batteries included"" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[33][34]

Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2.[36]

History[edit]

The designer of Python, Guido van Rossum, at OSCON 2006
Main article: History of Python
Python was invented in the late 1980s[41] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[42] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[11] Its implementation began in December 1989.[43] Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his ""permanent vacation"" from his responsibilities as Python's ""benevolent dictator for life"" (BDFL), a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker[44] (he's since come out of retirement and is self-titled ""BDFL-emeritus""). In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.[45][46]
Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support.[47] Python 3.0, released on 3 December 2008, with many of its major features backported to Python 2.6.x[48] and 2.7.x. Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.[49]
Python 2.7's end-of-life was initially set for 2015, then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.[50][51] No further security patches or other improvements will be released for it.[52][53] Currently only 3.8 and later are supported (2023 security issues were fixed in e.g. 3.7.17, the final 3.7.x release[54]). While Python 2.7 and older is officially unsupported, a different unofficial Python implementation, PyPy, continues to support Python 2, i.e. ""2.7.18+"" (plus 3.9 and 3.10), with the plus meaning (at least some) ""backported security updates"".[55]
In 2021 (and again twice in 2022), security updates were expedited, since all Python versions were insecure (including 2.7[56]) because of security issues leading to possible remote code execution[57] and web-cache poisoning.[58] In 2022, Python 3.10.4 and 3.9.12 were expedited[59] and 3.8.13, because of many security issues.[60] When Python 3.9.13 was released in May 2022, it was announced that the 3.9 series (joining the older series 3.8 and 3.7) would only receive security fixes in the future.[61] On 7 September 2022, four new releases were made due to a potential denial-of-service attack: 3.10.7, 3.9.14, 3.8.14, and 3.7.14.[62][63]
As of October 2023, Python 3.12 is the stable release, and 3.12 and 3.11 are the only versions with active (as opposed to just security) support. Notable changes in 3.11 from 3.10 include increased program execution speed and improved error reporting.[64]
Python 3.12 adds syntax (and in fact every Python since at least 3.5 adds some syntax) to the language, the new (soft) keyword type (recent releases have added a lot of typing support e.g. new type union operator in 3.10), and 3.11 for exception handling, and 3.10 the match and case (soft) keywords, for structural pattern matching statements. Python 3.12 also drops outdated modules and functionality, and future versions will too, see below in Development section.
Python 3.11 claims to be between 10 and 60% faster than Python 3.10, and Python 3.12 adds another 5% on top of that. It also has improved error messages, and many other changes.
Since 27 June 2023, Python 3.8 is the oldest supported version of Python (albeit in the 'security support' phase), due to Python 3.7 reaching end-of-life.[65]
Python 3.13 has a garbage collector which is now incremental (can mean much shorter pauses), and has an experimental JIT compiler;[66] and it removes from the C API (and removes some standard library modules, 19 dead batteries, and many deprecated classes, functions and methods, and more will be removed in Python 3.15 and or 3.16).[67] Starting with 3.13, it and later versions have 2 years of full support (up from one and a half); followed by 3 years of security support (for same total support as before).",Why was Python 2.7's end-of-life initially postponed from 2015 to 2020?,True,The end-of-life for Python 2.7 was postponed because there was a large body of existing code that could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.,grounded_correct,Python 2.7's end-of-life date was postponed from 2015 to 2020 because there was concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.,grounded_correct,"```
Answer: Python 2.7's end-of-life was initially postponed from 2015 to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.

History[edit]

The designer of Python, Guido van Rossum, at OSCON 2006
Main article: History of Python
Python was invented in the late 1980s[41] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[42] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[11] Its implementation began in December 1989.[43] Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his ""permanent vacation"" from his responsibilities as Python's ""benevolent dictator for life"" (BDFL), a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker[44] (he's since come out of retirement and is self-titled ""BDFL-emeritus""). In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.[45][46]
Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support.[47] Python 3.0, released on 3 December 2008, with many of its major features backported to Python 2.6.x[48] and 2.7.x. Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.[49]
Python 2.7's end-of-life was initially set for 2015, then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.[50][51] No further security patches or other improvements will be released for it.[52][53] Currently only 3.8 and later are supported (2023 security issues were fixed in e.g. 3.7.17, the final 3.7.x release[54]). While Python 2.7 and older is officially unsupported, a different unofficial Python implementation, PyPy, continues to support Python 2, i.e. ""2.7.18+"" (plus 3.9 and 3.10), with the plus meaning (at least some) ""backported security updates"".[55]
In 2021 (and again twice in 2022), security updates were expedited, since all Python versions were insecure (including 2.7[56]) because of security issues leading to possible remote code execution[57] and web-cache poisoning.[58] In 2022, Python 3.10.4 and 3.9.12 were expedited[59] and 3.8.13, because of many security issues.[60] When Python 3.9.13 was released in May 2022, it was announced that the 3.9 series (joining the older series 3.8 and 3.7) would only receive security fixes in the future.[61] On 7 September 2022, four new releases were made due to a potential denial-of-service attack: 3.10.7, 3.9.14, 3.8.14, and 3.7.14.[62][63]
As of October 2023, Python 3.12 is the stable release, and 3.12 and 3.11 are the only versions with active (as opposed to just security) support. Notable changes in 3.11 from 3.10 include increased program execution speed and improved error reporting.[64]
Python 3.12 adds syntax (and in fact every Python since at least 3.5 adds some syntax) to the language, the new (soft) keyword type (recent releases have added a lot of typing support e.g. new type union operator in 3.10), and 3.11 for exception handling, and 3.10 the match and case (soft) keywords, for structural pattern matching statements. Python 3.12 also drops outdated modules and functionality, and future versions will too, see below in Development section.
Python 3.11 claims to be between 10 and 60% faster than Python 3.10, and Python 3.12 adds another 5% on top of that. It also has improved error messages, and many other changes.
Since 27 June 2023, Python 3.8 is the oldest supported version of Python (albeit in the 'security support' phase), due to Python 3.7 reaching end-of-life.[65]
Python 3.13 has a garbage collector which is now incremental (can mean much shorter pauses), and has an experimental JIT compiler;[66] and it removes from the C API (and removes some standard library modules, 19 dead batteries, and many deprecated classes, functions and methods, and more will be removed in Python 3.15 and or 3.16).[67] Starting with 3.13, it and later versions have 2 years of full support (up from one and a half); followed by 3 years of security support (for same total support as before).",In what years were security updates for Python expedited?,True,Answer: 2021 and 2022.,grounded_correct,"Security updates for Python were expedited in 2021, and twice in 2022. This was due to security issues affecting all Python versions.",grounded_correct,"```
Answer: In 2021, 2022 (twice), and 2023 (four times).

History[edit]

The designer of Python, Guido van Rossum, at OSCON 2006
Main article: History of Python
Python was invented in the late 1980s[41] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[42] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[11] Its implementation began in December 1989.[43] Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his ""permanent vacation"" from his responsibilities as Python's ""benevolent dictator for life"" (BDFL), a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker[44] (he's since come out of retirement and is self-titled ""BDFL-emeritus""). In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.[45][46]
Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support.[47] Python 3.0, released on 3 December 2008, with many of its major features backported to Python 2.6.x[48] and 2.7.x. Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.[49]
Python 2.7's end-of-life was initially set for 2015, then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.[50][51] No further security patches or other improvements will be released for it.[52][53] Currently only 3.8 and later are supported (2023 security issues were fixed in e.g. 3.7.17, the final 3.7.x release[54]). While Python 2.7 and older is officially unsupported, a different unofficial Python implementation, PyPy, continues to support Python 2, i.e. ""2.7.18+"" (plus 3.9 and 3.10), with the plus meaning (at least some) ""backported security updates"".[55]
In 2021 (and again twice in 2022), security updates were expedited, since all Python versions were insecure (including 2.7[56]) because of security issues leading to possible remote code execution[57] and web-cache poisoning.[58] In 2022, Python 3.10.4 and 3.9.12 were expedited[59] and 3.8.13, because of many security issues.[60] When Python 3.9.13 was released in May 2022, it was announced that the 3.9 series (joining the older series 3.8 and 3.7) would only receive security fixes in the future.[61] On 7 September 2022, four new releases were made due to a potential denial-of-service attack: 3.10.7, 3.9.14, 3.8.14, and 3.7.14.[62][63]
As of October 2023, Python 3.12 is the stable release, and 3.12 and 3.11 are the only versions with active (as opposed to just security) support. Notable changes in 3.11 from 3.10 include increased program execution speed and improved error reporting.[64]
Python 3.12 adds syntax (and in fact every Python since at least 3.5 adds some syntax) to the language, the new (soft) keyword type (recent releases have added a lot of typing support e.g. new type union operator in 3.10), and 3.11 for exception handling, and 3.10 the match and case (soft) keywords, for structural pattern matching statements. Python 3.12 also drops outdated modules and functionality, and future versions will too, see below in Development section.
Python 3.11 claims to be between 10 and 60% faster than Python 3.10, and Python 3.12 adds another 5% on top of that. It also has improved error messages, and many other changes.
Since 27 June 2023, Python 3.8 is the oldest supported version of Python (albeit in the 'security support' phase), due to Python 3.7 reaching end-of-life.[65]
Python 3.13 has a garbage collector which is now incremental (can mean much shorter pauses), and has an experimental JIT compiler;[66] and it removes from the C API (and removes some standard library modules, 19 dead batteries, and many deprecated classes, functions and methods, and more will be removed in Python 3.15 and or 3.16).[67] Starting with 3.13, it and later versions have 2 years of full support (up from one and a half); followed by 3 years of security support (for same total support as before).",What kind of compilers does Python 3.13 introduce?,True,Python 3.13 introduces an experimental JIT compiler.,grounded_correct,Python 3.13 introduces an experimental JIT compiler.,grounded_correct,"```

Python was invented in the late 1980s[41] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[42] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[11] Its implementation began in December 1989.[43] Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his ""permanent vacation"" from his responsibilities as Python's ""benevolent dictator for life"" (BDFL), a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker[44] (he's since come out of retirement and is self-titled ""BDFL-emeritus""). In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.[45][46]
Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support.[47] Python 3.0, released on 3 December 2008, with many of its major features backported to Python 2.6.x[48] and 2.7.x. Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.[49]
Python 2.7's end-of-life was initially set for 2015, then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.[50][51] No further security patches or other improvements will be released for it.[52][53] Currently only 3.8 and later are supported (2023 security issues were fixed in e.g. 3.7.17, the final 3.7.x release[54]). While Python 2.7 and older is officially unsupported, a different unofficial Python implementation, PyPy, continues to support Python 2, i.e. ""2.7.18+"" (plus 3.9 and 3.10), with the plus meaning (at least some) ""backported security updates"".[55]
In 2021 (and again twice in 2022), security updates were expedited, since all Python versions were insecure (including 2.7[56]) because of security issues leading to possible remote code execution[57] and web-cache poisoning.[58] In 2022, Python 3.10.4 and 3.9.12 were expedited[59] and 3.8.13, because of many security issues.[60] When Python 3.9.13 was released in May 2022, it was announced that the 3.9 series (joining the older series 3.8 and 3.7) would only receive security fixes in the future.[61] On 7 September 2022, four new releases were made due to a potential denial-of-service attack: 3.10.7, 3.9.14, 3.8.14, and 3.7.14.[62][63]
As of October 2023, Python 3.12 is the stable release, and 3.12 and 3.11 are the only versions with active (as opposed to just security) support. Notable changes in 3.11 from 3.10 include increased program execution speed and improved error reporting.[64]
Python 3.12 adds syntax (and in fact every Python since at least 3.5 adds some syntax) to the language, the new (soft) keyword type (recent releases have added a lot of typing support e.g. new type union operator in 3.10), and 3.11 for exception handling, and 3.10 the match and case (soft) keywords, for structural pattern matching statements. Python 3.12 also drops outdated modules and functionality, and future versions will too, see below in Development section.
Python 3.11 claims to be between 10 and 60% faster than Python 3.10, and Python 3.12 adds another 5% on top of that. It also has improved error messages, and many other changes.
Since 27 June 2023, Python 3.8 is the oldest supported version of Python (albeit in the 'security support' phase), due to Python 3.7 reaching end-of-life.[65]
Python 3.13 has a garbage collector which is now incremental (can mean much shorter pauses), and has an experimental JIT compiler;[66] and it removes from the C API (and removes some standard library modules, 19 dead batteries, and many deprecated classes, functions and methods, and more will be removed in Python 3.15 and or 3.16).[67] Starting with 3.13, it and later versions have 2 years of full support (up from one and a half); followed by 3 years of security support (for same total support as before).",What is the the new keyword introduced in Python 3.12?,True,"The new keyword introduced in Python 3.12 is ""type.""",grounded_correct,The new keyword type was introduced in Python 3.12.,grounded_correct,"```
I can answer this question. According to the context, the new keyword introduced in Python 3.12 is 'type'.

Python 3.12 adds syntax (and in fact every Python since at least 3.5 adds some syntax) to the language, the new (soft) keyword type (recent releases have added a lot of typing support e.g. new type union operator in 3.10), and 3.11 for exception handling, and 3.10 the match and case (soft) keywords, for structural pattern matching statements. Python 3.12 also drops outdated modules and functionality, and future versions will too, see below in Development section.

"Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.[32]
Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a ""batteries included"" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[33][34]

Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2.[36]
Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages, and has gained widespread use in the machine learning community.[37][38][39][40]
History[edit]

The designer of Python, Guido van Rossum, at OSCON 2006
Main article: History of Python
Python was invented in the late 1980s[41] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[42] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[11] Its implementation began in December 1989.[43] Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his ""permanent vacation"" from his responsibilities as Python's ""benevolent dictator for life"" (BDFL), a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker[44] (he's since come out of retirement and is self-titled ""BDFL-emeritus""). In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.[45][46]
Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support.[47] Python 3.0, released on 3 December 2008, with many of its major features backported to Python 2.6.x[48] and 2.7.x. Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.[49]
Python 2.7's end-of-life was initially set for 2015, then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.[50][51] No further security patches or other improvements will be released for it.[52][53] Currently only 3.8 and later are supported (2023 security issues were fixed in e.g. 3.7.17, the final 3.7.x release[54]). While Python 2.7 and older is officially unsupported, a different unofficial Python implementation, PyPy, continues to support Python 2, i.e. ""2.7.18+"" (plus 3.9 and 3.10), with the plus meaning (at least some) ""backported security updates"".[55]
In 2021 (and again twice in 2022), security updates were expedited, since all Python versions were insecure (including 2.7[56]) because of security issues leading to possible remote code execution[57] and web-cache poisoning.[58] In 2022, Python 3.10.4 and 3.9.12 were expedited[59] and 3.8.13, because of many security issues.[60] When Python 3.9.13 was released in May 2022, it was announced that the 3.9 series (joining the older series 3.8 and 3.7) would only receive security fixes in the future.[61] On 7 September 2022, four new releases were made due to a potential denial-of-service attack: 3.10.7, 3.9.14, 3.8.14, and 3.7.14.[62][63]
As of October 2023, Python 3.12 is the stable release, and 3.12 and 3.11 are the only versions with active (as opposed to just security) support. Notable changes in 3.11 from 3.10 include increased program execution speed and improved error reporting.[64]
Python 3.12 adds syntax (and in fact every Python since at least 3.5 adds some syntax) to the language, the new (soft) keyword type (recent releases have added a lot of typing support e.g. new type union operator in 3.10), and 3.11 for exception handling, and 3.10 the match and case (soft) keywords, for structural pattern matching statements. Python 3.12 also drops outdated modules and functionality, and future versions will too, see below in Development section.
